This page is where you can iterate. Follow the lab instructions in the [readme.md](./README.md).

<!-- Import Data -->
```js
const nyc = await FileAttachment("data/nyc.json").json();
const results = await FileAttachment("data/election_results.csv").csv({ typed: true });
const survey = await FileAttachment("data/survey_responses.csv").csv({ typed: true });
const events = await FileAttachment("data/campaign_events.csv").csv({ typed: true });

// Note: you don't have to keep this, but some helpful data exposure to see what we've loaded. 
// NYC geoJSON data
display(nyc)
// Campaign data (first 10 objects)
display(results.slice(0,10))
display(survey.slice(0,10))
display(events.slice(0,10))
```


```js
// The nyc file is saved in data as a topoJSON instead of a geoJSON. Thats primarily for size reasons -- it saves us 3MB of data. For Plot to render it, we have to convert it back to its geoJSON feature collection. 
const districts = topojson.feature(nyc, nyc.objects.districts)
display(districts)
```

```js
// Simple rendering of the NYC districts topoJSON
Plot.plot({
  // this projection is already zoomed into NYC
  projection: {
    domain: districts,
    type: "mercator",
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.geo(districts),
  ]
})
```
